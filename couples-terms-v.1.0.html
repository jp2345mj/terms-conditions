        <h2>15. Consent and Safety</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Important Safety Guidelines:</strong> This App is designed to bring couples closer together through playful and intimate activities. Your safety, comfort, and consent are our top priorities.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Fundamental Principles:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent is Essential:</strong> All activities suggested by this App must be consensual between both partners. Never pressure or coerce your partner into any activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Communication:</strong> Always prioritize honest, open communication with your partner about boundaries, preferences, and comfort levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Right to Refuse:</strong> You have the absolute right to skip, modify, or refuse any suggested activity at any time, for any reason.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect Boundaries:</strong> Learning about each other's preferences and boundaries brings you closer together. Respect these boundaries completely.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Customization for Safety:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disable Unwanted Content:</strong> Feel free to disable any options you're not interested in or that don't feel right for your relationship.</li>
            <li><strong>Activity Management:</strong> You can add, edit, or remove activities to match your preferences and comfort levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Boundaries Together:</strong> Use the customization features to establish boundaries before playing any games.</li>
            <li><strong>Start Gradually:</strong> Begin with games that match your current comfort level and progress at your own pace.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>During Gameplay:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Go at Your Pace:</strong> Take your time and don't rush through activities. The timers are suggestions only.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Connection:</strong> Use these games as conversation starters about preferences rather than focusing solely on completion.</li>
            <li><strong>Check-In Regularly:</strong> Communicate openly during activities about what you enjoy and what you don't.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop if Uncomfortable:</strong> If anything feels uncomfortable or wrong, stop immediately and talk about it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The goal is to explore, communicate, and enhance your connection in a fun and safe way</li>
            <li>Focus on intimacy and connection rather than competition or performance</li>
            <li>Every couple is different - what works for others may not work for you, and that's perfectly normal</li>
            <li>Most importantly, have fun and enjoy exploring together while respecting each other's boundaries</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
